##### What is the difference between null and undefined?
null is *'I know what that is but I don't have one'*
undefined is *'I don't know what you're talking about'*

==========================================
##### Why does '0 == false' evaluate to true, but '0 === false' evaluate to false?
0 is the same 'value' as false. but not the same type.
0 is an integer, and false is a boolean.

== checks for value

=== checks for value*and*type

==========================================
##### Are '9' and 9 the same type and value?
false. '9' and 9 are the same value, not the same type.

==========================================
##### What does the '%' operator return?
it returns the *remainder* of two divided numbers. it is often used to determine if a number is even or odd by checking if the remainder of two divided numbers is 0.
