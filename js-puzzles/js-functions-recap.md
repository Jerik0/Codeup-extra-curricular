# Javascript Functions Recap

What are the components of a function?

`function` <--- the **keyword** 'function' defines that what is coming next is a function

`function myFunction` <--- the **function name**, pretty straight-forward.

`function myFunction()` <--- the parenthesis that are used to **pass a parameter** inside of.

`function myFunction() {`
    this is the **function body**, placed in between the {} that does stuff
`}`

Every function needs a return type, in other words, something that the function ***outputs*** when it is called/used. Example: 

`function myFunction() {`
    return ***some type of value here*** 
`}`

And that entirely encompasses what is called a ***function definition***. A function is like a tool that we create to be used for later.

A function ***call*** is when we are going to ***use*** the function that we defined earlier. We do this by typing:

`myFunction();`

This will make the function do whatever it is that you told it to do.

### What's the difference between a parameter and an argument?

##### A parameter is a *placeholder* for passing *anything* into the function body to be used. Example:
`function myFunction(`*parameter here*`) {`

    use the passed parameter in here somewhere
    
`}`
