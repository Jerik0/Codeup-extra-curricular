# Researching

When you inevitably come across a problem that you don't know how to solve, the next logical step is to look for the answer or at least some help finding the answer online. 

But it can be challenging to find the answer online, if you don't know how to find the answer, or maybe you don't know what question to ask.

Though it might be a little challenging sometimes, its actually pretty simple to find the answer to what you're looking for most of the time if you just take a second to think about what it is that you're really trying to do.

There are only a couple of steps to remember in order to research effectively.

The first thing you need to do is, as always, take a step back and really think about what it is exactly that you need to do.

Once you understand exactly what it is that you need to do, think about the pieces of technology or concepts that you know or have learned about, that could help you.

After that, try to write out any code that you can that will solve the problem.

If you've written code that you know and it still isn't enough to solve the problem that you have, or you think it might be enough, but it isn't working the way you want, then you search online.

The best way to search online is by asking straight-forward, plain-english questions about the piece of technology you're trying to use. 
For example: you're trying to use a forEach loop but you keep getting undefined, ask google exactly that. Your google search would be 'forEach returning undefined', or something similar.

Also, the important thing is to make sure that you're reading carefully when you get a response from google. Some things may be *similar* to what you're looking for, but not exactly what you need.

A recommendation as well is to try to avoid copying and pasting code, especially when you don't fully understand what it does. If you want to use the code that you found, write out the code that you see, by hand, line-by-line and make sure that you understand every line. This way you will learn better and retain the information that you've used. Your understanding can grow, and so next time you come across this problem (which is likely) or you're going to use this technique again, you will remember because you typed it out and took the time to understand it.

A final note:
Instructors and myself absolutely do not mind helping you with questions that you may have. However, in order for you to maximize what you get out of this class, it is imperative that you work towards learning how to answer your own questions, because once you get placed into a development career, you will likely need to rely on your own problem-solving ability. 

With this in mind, before you ask a question, make sure you read documentation, google, and/or stack overflow for the solution. 

TL;DR
Try to get better at solving your own problems, so you can become self-sufficient at coding. Even if you don't know/remember how to accomplish a specific thing, you can get the answer that you need on your own, which is more difficult yes, but overall better for you. And since we want you to succeed here, what's better for you is encouraged.
