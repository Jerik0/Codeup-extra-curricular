# Solving For X
### Well What Even Is X??

As I'm sure most beginner programmers experience in their early days of programming, they come across a word problem and it asks them for a specific thing... the only real problem is that they don't understand how to get the blinking cursor to turn into stuff.

If this happens(ed) to you, worry not! It at least happened to me, and most likely lots of others.

If there are any 'main' skills in programming, I would say that 'code-interpretation' -or translating a problem from words to actual code- is one of them.

Unfortunately a lot of recognition of patterns used in programming just comes down to raw experience. I'm sure you've heard experienced programmers say 'Well just start coding!'... Great, thanks for the support, dude. But honestly it kind of is just like that in a manner of speaking. You just need to start. 

Luckily, practice makes perfect. Or near perfect. However, its hard to build a house if you've never seen one, or if you don't know what a hammer is or how to use it. So the first steps would be learning:

* That a hammer is a thing you use to build
* How to use it
* Look at a house, see how its built
* Maybe look at how other people have built houses

See, it would be overwhelming if I told you to build a house without you having the knowledge first. 

Also, the first house you build might take you forever to build, because it was the first time you ever built one. And it might officially be called a 'house', but it may have problems, or not have entirely everything a house needs. And that's okay, because you learned from it. 

If I was asked to attach a couple of pieces of wood together, I would know that I need a hammer. Why? Because I know that a hammer exists, and that it is used for nailing things together. And I would know I need nails. Why? Because I know that they are needed for holding wood together mostly. 

Why do I know these things? Did I pick them up out of the ether? No, I am just familiar enough with them to know that I need them. 

So it really is very much familiarity with the tools that makes us better at knowing the correct tool for the job.

===============================

When we read a word problem, we need to break down the problem into small, individual and isolated parts that we can solve with the tools that we know we have available. 

For a developer, the tools we use might be a 'for loop', or any kind of 'control structure'. Knowing when and how to use these things is the key component to interpreting word problems into code more easily.

So, try to take the tools that you have been taught or are being taught, and think of each piece as a tool that you can add to your toolbox that's available to use when trying to 'solve for x'. 

Just understand and always remember that there are most likely going to be a lot more tools that exist that you don't know about. You can always find out about them if you look on the G.O.G. though!

If you have the tools, and you are familiar with them, but you're still having a hard time translating the problem to code, then the problem is most likely with process of actually **_breaking the problem down_** into small pieces. 

Example:

_I want you to make me a function that takes in a string and makes it capitalized._

Here's how I would break that problem down:

* What is a function? How do I make one?
* What is a string? 
* How does a function 'take in' a string??
* How in the world to I capitalize a string? (maybe I should look through the curriculum or google it...)
* How do we get output from this function?

See, even that simple instruction has several parts that you can/should break it down into. If you break things down very simply, and *make sure* you understand every single part of it, you can start writing the code to make it happen.
