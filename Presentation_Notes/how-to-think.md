# How To Think

Whether you're in Codeup, or you already have that fancy new developer job that you are after, there is a skill that you need to develop along with learning syntax for a given language. That skill is meta-cognition. Meta-cognition is *thinking about how you are thinking.* 

Instead of typing things on a screen and seeing if they are working or not, why not take a step back for a second and think 'What am I trying to do?' and then 'What do I know that can help me?'. 

This will help you to not only realize that you might very well know the answer if you just take your time, but it will also help you to realize the things you really *don't* know, so you can then ask for help from an instructor or GOG (good ol' google).

## The Defeatist Attitude
Being a developer of any kind requires us to solve for problems that we may or may not have created, on a regular basis. So naturally, we as developers need to realize a few things.

* We do not, and never will, know everything.
* We are not going to be able to remember everything always.
* Solving problems is the key component of our chosen career, so we should accept it and improve at it
* We will sometimes need to ask for help. Because, after all, we're not superhuman! (I won't tell if you won't)
* We are not as fast as we think we are, at least at first. It's important to take our time understanding the problem or question first, so we can solve it effectively.

It can be overwhelming if we fail to realize those things, and can lead to what I like to call the 'Defeatist' attitude. It makes us ineffective not only as developers but producers in general when we are beating ourselves up because 'I should have known that' or 'I'll never get this to work', or 'I have no idea what I'm doing'.

It's very important to take any problem that you come into contact with, one bite at a time, and really take the time to think about the problem, it will be easier to solve. 

If you still do not know how to solve it, you're in luck! We happen to live in the golden age of what I like to call 'the Interwebs' - A magical place where all of your questions can be answered. We live in the information age, and if we take the time to understand what we need or what we are trying to ask, finding the solution is much easier.
