# Habits And How To Form Them

Related to meta-cognition - or "thinking about our thinking", forming habits, as you all most likely know, takes a lot of self-awareness and self-control.

How many of you have ever attempted to create an awesome habit, regardless of what it was, did it once or twice, or maybe even a week, but fizzled out?

Yeah that's what I thought, do you know why you did that?

It's because science! There are two parts of the brain that we deal with on a daily basis, all day long, that are responsible for what we do with ourselves.

The first part is called the basil ganglia. It is responsible for our habits, what we're used to, what we find to be normal. We use it when we go home every day, throw off our backpack and sit there and watch netflix. When we do that, day after day, we are telling our basil ganglia that yes, this is fine and you should get used to this more and more. So we say that we're *used* to this behavior. When we try to do something else other than throwing off our backpack and watching netflix when we get home, it feels strange because we've told our basil ganglia to memorize what 'normal' is. 

The second part is called the pre-frontal cortex which directly affects decision-making. When you have those bursts where you get motivated enough to take action in your life, you finally try to make a change that you know that you need -that you know is right- you make a *decision* with your pre-frontal cortex that directly contradicts your basil ganglia's comfort-zone. You're now telling your basil ganglia, 'uhh actually, lets do this instead...' and your basil ganglia is like 'well but... you said netflix was normal, and good'. So you are literally arguing with yourself.

When you make a decision, the reason it feels so strange is because your basil ganglia is being contradicted by your decision. It feels weird, and uncomfortable. But it is super important that you understand what's happening when that strange feeling takes you over.

When you feel strange because you're 'contradicting' yourself, your brain is literally carving new paths that will *eventually* affect your basil ganglia's comfort zone, and form a new habit. You actually have to push against your own brain consistently enough that you make it get used to what is right. 

Whether its working out, learning a new programming language or just eating right, everything takes practice, specifically because we have to fight against our own brains. 

We all know what the right thing is to do, we just don't do it a lot of the time, because its hard. But I think understanding the process of what is going on when we try to break/make habits is super important to success. If we understand what is going on when that strange feeling takes over, when that discomfort makes us want to quit, we can remember, 'oh, thats just my brain arguing with itself. screw you brain, you gon learn today'.

We just have to stick with it and push through the mental discomfort to make ourselves do what we really know we need to do, so we can tell our basil ganglia that its definition of normal is being re-defined.

So if you know that you need to study more, or you need to take extra time to learn concepts in class, then do it! Understand that it may feel pretty weird breaking through your basil ganglia's comfort zone and directly arguing with yourself. Just remember that its necessary, and you made that decision for a big reason.
