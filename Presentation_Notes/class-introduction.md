# Study Hall Introduction

Welcome to the first ever weekly study hall!

This is something new that I'm working with the staff to develop, to better assist you guys in getting the best bang for your buck that you paid to be here.

The purpose of this study hall every week will be pretty flexible to be honest, and it may vary from week-to-week what you will get when you sit in for it. 

Sometimes, we might be reinforcing ideas and concepts from the entire week before, if you guys want that.

Sometimes I will talk about a motivational piece that I believe would benefit you guys in your time here, and/or in life in general. 

Sometimes I'll have puzzles to solve, to solidify your knowledge of the concepts we're on in class, or things that we have covered.

But *always*, you guys can ask questions. I will answer any questions that you ask that I have the ability to answer.

And *always* I will answer questions that you may not have even known that you had.

That is a big thing to me, because so many times I hear students telling me that they didn't know what question to ask and that's what is impeding their progress here. 

Literally anything that you guys need this to be is what it will be.

At the end of every session, I'll give out a small survey, asking everyone some questions regarding different things. Generally pertaining to how we can improve your experience in this section of the class.

## About Me
So I know you guys don't know me very well, so just for a second here, I want to let you know where I'm coming from so I can establish some credibility with you guys.

I went to Codeup last year about this time, and came in knowing nothing. I didn't find out that I would be able to be in the starting class until the friday before, so I had to do all the pre-work before I came in that next Monday.

While I was in class, I was pulled in so many directions, I didn't ask all the questions I could, and a lot of the time I didn't even know what I didn't know. I didn't even know what questions to ask when they said 'any questions?'.

I struggled through every section just to wrap my head around concepts as we went through class but I eventually did. 

The point is, I understand where you're sitting, and I've seen a lot of students that feel like I felt. So I am using that unique viewpoint to improve your time here if possible.

The number one thing that I want is for all of you to learn, regardless of the level you came in at. Like a good friend of mine said, I want to help those of you that have difficulty, and challenge the ones that excel. 

I'm also here to take some questions you guys may have about the curriculum, the pace, etc. 

Think of me like a liaison between you and the staff, someone whose focus is you guys, and the more human aspect of being here at Codeup.

Sweet! Now that that's out of the way...
